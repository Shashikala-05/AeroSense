# 📖 Overview

AeroSense is an AI and IoT-based smart air quality monitoring system designed to assist asthma and allergy patients in monitoring environmental conditions. The system collects live sensor data using an ESP32 microcontroller, displays the readings through an interactive web dashboard, predicts air quality trends, and alerts users whenever pollution reaches unsafe levels.

The goal of AeroSense is to provide an affordable, portable, and intelligent solution that helps users make informed health decisions based on real-time air quality.

# ❗ Problem Statement

Air pollution has become one of the major causes of respiratory diseases worldwide. Individuals suffering from asthma and allergies are highly vulnerable to harmful gases and poor air quality. Existing air quality monitoring systems are often expensive, location-specific, or do not provide personalized health alerts.

AeroSense addresses this challenge by offering a portable and intelligent air quality monitoring system capable of real-time monitoring, prediction, and health notifications.

# 🎯 Objectives

- Monitor environmental air quality in real time.
- Collect live sensor readings continuously.
- Predict future air quality using AI techniques.
- Alert users when pollution exceeds safe thresholds.
- Provide health precautions for asthma and allergy patients.
- Develop a responsive web dashboard for easy monitoring.
